<h1><b>Compliance-First Investment Recommendation System for Retail Banking</b></h1>
<h3>AI-Driven, Behavior-Based Policy Recommendations with Risk-Suitability & Regulatory Compliance Enforcement</h3>

<p>
Traditional investment recommendation systems optimize returns — but rarely consider <b>liquidity needs</b>, <b>customer suitability</b>, and <b>regulatory compliance</b>.<br>
This system prioritizes <b>financial safety</b> and <b>responsible recommendation</b> by analyzing spending behavior, volatility, surplus ratios, and debt exposure before predicting investment products.
